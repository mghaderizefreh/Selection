! This is a sample input file.
! Lines that start with exclamation mark are skipped.
! empty lines are also skipped.

! [int] verbosity: '1' = produces lots of information, else = quiet
0
! [int] number of animals in each generation
900
! [int] number of chromosome
1
! [*] base-name for genepool with integer representation of genes
! the number of individuals must be greater than number of animals
! the format should be <basename><xxx> with xxx starting from 001
pedigree.ch
! [*] base-name for gene positions same format as above
SNPpositions.t
! [real] length of chromosome (assuming all chromosomes have equal length)
1.0
! [real] mutation rate (scientic notations are accepted)
1.e-5
! [int] number of components. 2 if random regression is involved (slope+intercept)
2
! ncomp x [real] genetic variance component for simulation where ncomp = # of components
3.0
3.0
! ncomp x [real] environmental variance component for simulation where ncomp = # 
! of components
7.0
7.0
! ncorr x [real] correlation structure where ncorr = (ncomp+1)(ncomp+2)/2
! when ncomp = 1 => 1.0 should be placed
! when ncomp = 2 => 1.0 [newline] <correlation> [newlien] 1.0 should be placed
1.0
0.5
1.0
! [int] number of QTLs on each chromosome
500
! [int] number of SNPs on each chromosome (excluding QTL)
1000
! [int] number of locations per individual (nlox)
5
! [int] are locations random? 
! 1:Yes, else: no : Therefore, next line should indicate whether locations are 
! common (1:yes, else:no) : if yes, the next if not, the next <nlox> lines should
! be locations [real] otherwise next line shuld be a file containing locations
! with (nlocations x nanimal) [real] inputs in matrix format
! e.g. (locations are random)
! 1
! or (locations are not random, they are common, with values 0.3, 0.5, 0.9)
! 0
! 1
! 0.3
! 0.5
! 0.9
! or (custom locations, i.e., not random, not common and name of the file
! 0
! 0
! locations.txt
1
! selection type
! 1 = random, 2 = slopeEBV, 3 = interceptEBV, 4 = slopeTBV, 5 = interceptTBV
2
! number of males
10
! number of females per male
30
! number of offspring per female
3
! number of generations
1
! analysis type (1 = random regression, 2 = single trait)
! depending on the nlox and selection type it may not make sense to choose one
1
! is reml required (1 = Yes, else = no , i.e., a blup will be performed)
! this input may be discarded depending on the selection type
1
! ncomp x [real] means for traits
