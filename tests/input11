!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! genomic information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! [int] number of chromosome
1
! [*] base-name for genepool with integer representation of
! genes the number of individuals must be greater than number 
! of animals the format should be <basename><xxx> with xxx
! starting from 001
../../tselection/tests/original.ch
! [*] base-name for gene positions same format as above
../../tselection/tests/SNPpositions.t
! [real] length of chromosome (assuming all equal length)

! [real] mutation rate (scientic notations are accepted)
1.e-6
! [int] number of QTLs on each chromosome
500
! [int] number of SNPs on each chromosome (excluding QTL)
1000
! [int] randomQTL: 1 = QTLs will be selected randomly,
! else = QTLs will be selected
! from the alleses with MAF above a certain threshold
1
! [real] MAF for QTL selection. If randomQTL = True,
! this will be ignored, otherwise
! MAF must be in interval [0,0.5)
0.05
! [*] base-name for frequency files. If randomQTL = True this
! will be ignored, otherwise
! as many files are required as there are chromosomes
freq.txt
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! genetic infomration !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! [int] number of components. 2 if random regression is
! involved (slope+intercept)
2
! ncomp x [real] genetic variance component for simulation
! where ncomp = # of components

! ncomp x [real] environmental variance component for
! simulation where ncomp = # 
! of components
0.90
0.90
! ncorr x [real] correlation struct ncorr=(ncomp+1)(ncomp+2)/2
! when ncomp = 1 => 1.0 should be placed
! when ncomp = 2 => 1.0 [newline] <correlation> [newlien] 1.0
! should be placed

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! population information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! [int] number of animals in each generation
900
! number of males

! number of females per male

! number of offspring per female
3
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! phenotype information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! [real] xmin (minimum value of enviornmental challenge)
0.0
! [real] xmax (maximum value of environmental challenge)
2.0
! [int] number of locations per individual (nlox)
3
! [int] number of farms
15
! [real] relative extent of each farm ( < 1); proportion of
! covering whole range
0.1
! [int] allocation scenario
! 1 = random, 2 = clustered

! ncomp x [real] means for traits

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! selection information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! selection type
! 1 = random, 2 = local performance, 3 = index (real weights
! required [ncomp])
1
0.6
0.4
! number of generations
3
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! analysis information !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! variance estimation
! 1 = reml, 2 = from first generation, 3 = used as simulated
! this input may be discarded depending on selection type
1
! should the effect of farms be estimated? (1 = Yes, else = no)
! If farm effects are estimated they will be used instead of
! environmental values (i.e., reacion norm analysis) otherwise,
! exact value of farms will be used. The estimated farm effects
! will be rescaled so that they map from xmin to xmax. If
! selection is local this option adds farms as fixed effects
! to the model. Note that this option may be ignored if
! selection is random
1
! If farm effects are to be considered, they will be rescaled
! from next two input (min, max, respectively). Otherwise, they
! will be ignored
